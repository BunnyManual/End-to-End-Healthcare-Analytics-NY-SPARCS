Complete DAX Measures for Power BI Dashboard
This file contains all the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures created in Power BI to power the interactive dashboard. The table name inpatient_discharges is used in these examples.

Core KPI Measures
1. Calculates the total number of patient discharges.
Total Discharges = COUNT('inpatient_discharges'[Facility Name])

2. Calculates the average length of stay for all discharges.
Avg. LOS = AVERAGE('inpatient_discharges'[Length of Stay])

3. Calculates the sum of all hospital charges.
Total Charges = SUM('inpatient_discharges'[Total Charges])

4. Calculates the average charge per discharge.
Avg. Charges = AVERAGE('inpatient_discharges'[Total Charges])

5. Calculates the average cost per discharge.
Avg. Costs = AVERAGE('inpatient_discharges'[Total Costs])

Advanced & Contextual Measures
6. Calculates the percentage of total admissions that were emergencies.
This requires a helper measure first.

-- Helper Measure
Emergency Admissions = CALCULATE([Total Discharges], 'inpatient_discharges'[Type of Admission] = "Emergency")

-- Final Measure
% Emergency Admissions = DIVIDE([Emergency Admissions], [Total Discharges], 0)

7. Creates a dynamic title that reflects the current hospital system selection.
Selected System = SELECTEDVALUE('inpatient_discharges'[hospital_system], "All Hospital Systems")
